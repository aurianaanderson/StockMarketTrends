## **Predicting Stock Market Trends Using Historical Price Data**

#### Brief background

The stock market is heavily influenced by many factors like a company’s performance, investor
behavior and other economic conditions. Even though the market is unpredictable, traders rely
on trends to make decisions on investments. We want to determine whether machine learning can
identify short-term patterns to help predict if stock prices will increase or decrease the next 
day based on recent trends.

#### Question

Can we predict next-day up and down movement of S&amp;P 500 stocks using historical price and trade volume data?

#### Hypothesis & Predictions

## **Hypothesis**:

If recent stock trends and trading volumes show consistent patterns, then simple classification
models like logistic regression or random forest can predict next-day stock movement more
accurately than random guessing.


## **Prediction**:

We expect that our model will correctly predict stock direction 55-60% of the time. This is
slightly better than chance but will prove that short-term patterns contain usable information. Our
hope is that more historic data will improve the model’s overall accuracy.
